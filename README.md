# CoffeeSales_Kaggle
Simple EDA for open [dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales/data)

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to improve my data analysis skills:
- Data cleaning and practice with `pandas`
- Creating visualizations using `seaborn`

## Overview

In this notebook:
1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset directly from Kaggle
2. **Data Cleaning**: Drop missing values, formatting data types
3. **Data Exploration**: Using `pandas` for initial data inspection and generating descriptive statistics
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating various plots to explore relationships and trends within the data
